If you're reading this, it means you won a prize at the EthDenver 2023 Buidlathon.

Congratulations! 🎉

Now let's get you paid. 💸

## 🎇 Making Web3 Hackathon History 🎆
EthDenver 2023 is the **first** hackathon to leverage the tax compliant, on-chain payout system built by the fine folks at [OpenQ](https://openq.dev).

All 1.25 million USDC will be distributed via the OpenQ bounty system deployed on Polygon.

This means no more:

❌ DMs and emails with organizers to coordinate payouts

❌ Sending around wallet addresses

❌ Waiting weeks or even MONTHS for your payouts

❌ Paying high gas fees to re-distribute funds among your talented team members

Finally - a Web3 hackathon that *actually uses* Web3 for its bounty distribution.

## Awesome! So How Do I Start?
