# ETHDenver-2023 

If you landed on this repo it means you won a prize at ETHDenver 2023, congratulations :sparkles:!
This year, all ETHDenver prizes are awarded via OpenQ. This means you can expect an automated process to receive your prize money.

## What is OpenQ?
OpenQ is a customizable web3-native bounty distribution platform. Every issue you see in this repository is representing a bounty for ETHDenver 2023. OpenQ wraps smart contracts around these issues. After your submission, you will be entitled to claim the money in the smart contract after you have fulfilled all the requirements set by ETHDenver (more on this in the documentation). Our contracts are deployed on Polygon.

## How does it work?

You can find the documentation on how to get your prize money here:
https://docs.openq.dev/hackathon-winner/project-submission

Once the bounties and main prizes have been awarded, ETHDenver will deposit the prize money as a bounty for each team member on-chain. You will then be able to find all bounties on our website:
