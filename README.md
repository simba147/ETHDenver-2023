This year, all ETHDenver prizes are awarded via OpenQ. This means you can expect an automated process to receive the prize money.

## What is OpenQ?
OpenQ is a customizable web3-native bounty distribution platform. Every issue you see in this repository represents a bounty for ETHDenver 2023. OpenQ wraps smart contracts around these issues, which include the prize money in USDC.
